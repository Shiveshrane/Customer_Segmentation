# Customer_Segmentation

This project aims to segment customers using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and classify them using a Decision Tree classifier. The segmentation helps in understanding the different clusters within the customer base, and the classification model provides insights and predictions based on these clusters.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared customer data for analysis.
Feature Handling: Performed feature selection and engineering to enhance model performance.
Customer Segmentation: Implemented KNN algorithm to identify and label customer segments.
Classification: Built a Decision Tree model to classify customers into the segmented groups.
Visualization: Included plots and graphs to visualize the segments and classification results.
